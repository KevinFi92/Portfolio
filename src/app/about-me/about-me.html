    <p>Hi, I am Kevin. I started my journey as a web developer in 2024.
      Since than I have been building and refining my skills.
      I like solving problems as part of a team and constantly learning new technologies.
      Over time, I’ve developed a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and TypeScript and I’m comfortable working
      with modern
      frameworks like Angular. I also have experience with version control systems like Git
      and REST-API integration.</p>
